# ADR 0001: Record Architecture Decisions

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-10-22  

## Context
We are building a large-scale, polyglot, AI-native monorepo using multiple languages (TypeScript, Go, Python, Rust, Java) under MACH+, hexagonal, event-driven, and DDD principles.

Tracking key architectural decisions is essential to ensure consistency and traceability over time.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) stored in `docs/adr/`.  
Each ADR file will:
- Be numbered sequentially (`0001`, `0002`, etc.)
- Use Markdown
- Include status (`Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Deprecated`, etc.)

## Consequences
- Clear history of architectural reasoning
- Easier onboarding for new contributors
- Supports technical governance and audits
