# System Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture.

## Guiding Principles
- **MACH+** — Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native, Headless, Composable
- **Hexagonal Architecture** — Decoupled core domain logic
- **Event-driven** — Asynchronous communication via event store
- **CQRS + Sagas** — Read/write segregation and long-running transaction coordination
- **Federated Data Mesh** — Distributed ownership of data per domain
- **DDD + TDD + BDD** — Business-driven, test-first design
- **Cloud-native and agnostic** — Portable infrastructure

## System Context
TBD — will include a C4 Model diagram once services are defined.
