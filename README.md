# AI Monorepo

A polyglot, service-based monorepo built with MACH+, hexagonal architecture, event-driven design (EDA, CQRS, Sagas), and domain-driven design (DDD).

## Directory Layout
- **services/** – independent microservices by domain
- **packages/** – shared libraries and SDKs
- **infra/** – infrastructure-as-code and deployment definitions
- **docs/** – architecture and design documentation
- **tools/** – dev tools, generators, and automation scripts
- **scripts/** – build/test/deploy scripts

## Principles
- MACH+ Composability
- Clean/Hexagonal Architecture
- Event-driven with Event Store
- CQRS + Sagas
- TDD/BDD/DDD practices
- Cloud-native and Cloud-agnostic
- Federated Data Mesh
- Multi-tenant from the ground up
